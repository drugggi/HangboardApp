# Getting Started

HangboardApp is developed with the latest Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

# Usage

Select the grade and duration with slider and the HangboardApp generates the holds and grips for the workout. Holds and grips can be shuffled until preferable workout structure is found.

Time controls can be fully controlled in Time Controls menu if one so desires. Holds and grips can be manually changed by pressing target hang on the list until pop up list appears. User can only change left hand hold, right hand hold, or grip type at a time, So it takes three clicks to fully customize a hang.
